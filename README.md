Live version: [https://mitos.shared.oxide.computer/](https://mitos.shared.oxide.computer/)

## Features

- Generate ASCII art from multiple sources:
  - Images
  - GIFs
  - Custom JavaScript code
- Preprocessing controls (brightness, contrast, dithering, inversion)
- Customizable ASCII character sets
- Real-time preview with zoom and pan
- Animation support with playback controls
- Multiple export options
- Grid overlay

## Technology

Mitos is built with:

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- TailwindCSS
- CodeMirror (for the code editor)
- gifuct-js (GIF processing)

The project builds on [play.core](https://play.ertdfgcvb.xyz/) by Andreas Gysin (ertdfgcvb),
an ASCII rendering library with an API inspired by GLSL programming. Whilst it might be more
efficient to process and render the text directly to the DOM, sidestepping the need for a
libraryâ€” the library enables consistent rendering and easier packaging of self-contained
ASCII art components.

## Contributing

In its present state, Mitos is an internal tool for Oxide Computer Company and is tightly
coupled to Oxide's design system. While we're open to PRs, we are a small company and the
primary goal of this repo is as an internal tool, so we can't guarantee that all PRs will be
integrated.
